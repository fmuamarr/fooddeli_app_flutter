# Food Deli Restaurant App

This repository contains my submission for Dicoding's "Belajar Fundamental Aplikasi Flutter" class.

## Overview

- **UI Implementation**: Utilizes both Stateless and Stateful Widgets to build the user interface.
- **Restaurant Listing**: Fetches and displays a list of restaurants, including brief information and images, sourced from an API.
- **Restaurant Details**: Provides detailed information about each restaurant when selected from the list.
- **Search Functionality**: Includes a search feature to find restaurants by name or menu items.
- **Favorites Restaurant**: Allows users to add and remove restaurants from their favorites list using SQLite for local storage.
- **State Management**: Using provider state management.
- **Scheduling and Notifications**: Implements a daily reminder feature to notify users of a random restaurant at a specific time.
- **Testing**: Includes testing scenarios to ensure the application functions correctly, including verifying JSON parsing.
